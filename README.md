##Animated modal in React using onAnimationEnd
In this component, onAnimationEnd is used to create animation, just like in this [case](https://github.com/AndrewShedov/Animated-dropdown-menu-in-react). onAnimationEnd is the handler for the animationEnd event, which is called when the element's CSS animation ends. This component does not use third party libraries for animation and when the modal window is closed, it is not in the DOM.\
Start:\
npm install\
npm run dev\
